# Data Structures

This folder is for storage of data structures for me to make and use in the future. Often times these are concepts that we are assumed to already know, and making this is partially of my own desire to rehash what exists.

The point of this is to create these from scratch without built in functions. Once I have created one, if a built in example of it exist, such as an array, I will allow myself to use it.
