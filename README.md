# code-challenges
This is a space for warmups and code challenges for myself. The challenges will be pulled from online.

## Structure
- Each folder will have its own day titled by the date
- Each day will contain a code challenge from somewhere. 
- Each code challenge will have a README.md file containing the statement of the problem in how it is given
- A markdown file will be given with the following sections in order to mimic a whiteboarding session
  - problem statement
  - inputs
  - expected outputs
  - approach
  - pseudo code
- pseudo code will be copied into the final code
